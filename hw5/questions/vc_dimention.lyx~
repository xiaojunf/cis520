\begin_body

\begin_layout Section
VC Dimension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
VC=2k
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We mark the 2k points in an increasing way 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}<x_{i}<...x_{2k}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}=\frac{x_{i+1}-x_{i}}{2},\ and\ \delta=min\delta_{i}$
\end_inset

 and also k incrasing intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1}<a_{2},b_{2}<a_{3,...}b_{k-1}<a_{k}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

First prove 
\begin_inset Formula $VC(H)\geq2k$
\end_inset

, we can achieve all 1s by setting a large interval including all points
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=x_{i}-\delta,\ b_{1}=x_{2k}+\delta$
\end_inset

, and achieve all 0s by setting all intervals larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=x_{2k}+\delta$
\end_inset

, and mark 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq k$
\end_inset

 points to be positive, by setting n intervals so that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=x_{i}-\delta,b_{i}=x_{i}+\delta$
\end_inset

, if n>k, then there are 2k-n negative points, which can seperate the positive
 points into at most 
\begin_inset Formula $2k-n+1<k+1\leq k$
\end_inset

 clusters, cluster here means consecutive positive points, for the ith cluster,
 we set an interval 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

= first point in cluster-
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

=laster point in cluster+
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Second prove 
\begin_inset Formula $VC(H)\leq2k$
\end_inset

, proove by contradiction, suppose there are 2k+1 points, including k negative
 points, and k+1 positive points, and the k+1 positivle points are seperated
 by the k negative points, since the k intervals can include all k+1 positive
 points, then at least two positive points should be in one interval, meaning
 that the two points must be adjacent, which contradict our assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
VC(H)=2
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

First prove 
\begin_inset Formula $VC(H)\geq2$
\end_inset

, assume the two points are 
\begin_inset Formula $[x_{11},x_{12},...,x_{1n}],\ [x_{21},x_{22},...,x_{2n}]$
\end_inset

we can achieve all 1s setting the intervals in every dimention as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=min(x_{1i},x_{2i})-\delta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}=max(x_{1i},x_{2i})+\delta$
\end_inset

, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Labeling
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
N points in 1 dimention:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In one dimention, meaning adjacent points must have the same label except
 for the two points nearest the seperator.
 There are the following cases.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
All points are labeled the same positive or negative, 2 ways
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
all left k points are label the same, the rest are labeled the other, 
\begin_inset Formula $0<k<N$
\end_inset

, #(k)=N-1, since the left k points can be labeled in two ways, positive
 or negative, 2*#(k)=2N-2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the total number is 2N-2+2=2N.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
4 points in 2 dimention.
 We arrange the four points in a way so that there are no 3 points in the
 same line, then 3 of the points construnct a triangle, and the fourth point
 can be either inside or outside the triangle.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If inside, then if the inside point is labeled different from all other
 3 points, it is not seperable, since the inside point can be labeled either
 positive of negative, so the number is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{4}-2=14$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If outside, then if we label the points at the same diagonal line with same
 color, and different with the others, the points are not seperable, also
 it can be labeled in 2 ways, so , the number is also 14
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Like the 4 points in 2 dimention, we arrange the 5 points so that no 4 points
 are at the same plane, then with any 4 points we can construct tetrahedron,
 and the 5th point is either inside or outside the tetrahedron, similar
 to the problem above, for each situation there are 2 ways making the points
 unseperable, so the number is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{5}-2=30$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_body
